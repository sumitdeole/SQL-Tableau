## Tasks:
- Assume the role of a data analyst
- Use SQL and Tableau to create a presentation and present it in front of Eniac CEO

## Business concerns 
This market analysis will answer two primary concerns raised by the management:
1. Is Magist a good fit for high-end tech products?
2. Are orders delivered on time?

A 4-minute presentation answers both these concerns as detailed in the presentation slides - [Click here](https://github.com/sumitdeole/SQL-Tableau/blob/da5b045f6593d6246156d7715b9fdf5a6398f975/Magist%20ppt.pdf)
